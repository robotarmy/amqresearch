This is my first supervised worker process in erlang.
It is not clear how to implement a background supervised worker
properly.. I have hacked into the init a link on a spawned function.

I am not sure what the 'otp' way to do this is.

I made this to assist in getting feedback



starting app

ERL_LIBS=deps erl -pa ebin -s sender_app

# manually stop in console
application:stop(sender).

# manually start again in console.
application:start(sender).
